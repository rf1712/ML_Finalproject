# Stock prediction 
### Problem formulation 
##### We use the previous data to predict that whether the next minute's stock price will increase or decrease. In this way, we can make high frequency trading. In this project, we mainly focus on building models to train the data form Apple's Stock.

### Files
##### 1. Final Project.jpynb
##### 2. minute_data_restart.txt

### Main solution
##### 1. Neural network
##### 2. Linear regression

### Conclusion
##### Firstly, we try to use neural network method because the features of stocks are not obvious, and the accuracy reaches ##### 70%. This is enough for the high frequency stock trading. However, the parameters of linear and polynomial regression ##### have great impact on the results after analysing the correlations of features. So we process the data and build linear ##### regression model to predict the change of next minute's stock price compared to last minute's stock price. The #####directional accuracy reaches 82%.
